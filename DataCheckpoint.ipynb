    "Can we build a predictive model to estimate how many points an NBA superstar will score in a given game, based on player performance metrics, game location, opponent defensive stats, and team offensive context? Specifically, we will use variables such as Points per Game (PPG), Field Goal Attempts per Game (FGA), Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%), True Shooting Percentage (TS%), home/away status, opponent defensive rating, opponent FG% allowed, opponent PPG allowed, team offensive rating, and team pace."

    "All members of our group are passionate NBA fans and active sports bettors, and we wanted to take a data-driven approach to improve that decision-making process. Millions of fans like us attempt to guess whether NBA superstars will score over a certain number of points on platforms like PrizePicks, often relying on intuition, matchup narratives, or raw stat trends. \n",
    "\n",
    "While many projects exist that aim to predict general fantasy performance or player stat lines, few focus specifically on individual point prediction for NBA superstars, and even fewer do so with an emphasis on practical, daily usability. For instance, a relevant GitHub project is \"nba-player-points-prediction\"<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1), which used Linear Regression to predict point totals but lacked player-specific model tailoring and did not incorporate matchup context or intangible factors like rest or home/away which are limitations we aim to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another similar project, NBAplayer_Performance_Pred<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2), used Random Forest and Ridge Regression models to predict NBA player performance stats. While the project incorporated some useful statistical features, it focused more on general performance across all players rather than narrowing in on top scorers or real-world prediction usability. Also it did not include game-specific contextual variables such as rest days or injuries, which we believe are crucial for predicting scoring outputs on a game-to-game basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to design a tool that predicts a superstar’s point total on a given night by combining recent player performance, opponent defensive metrics, and game context (e.g., back-to-back games, home/away, rest days). Rather than building a generalized model across all players, we will narrow our scope to top scorers (top 50 in Points per game) in the regular season and aim for game-to-game predictive accuracy that could be realistically applied by fans, fantasy players, or bettors looking to gain an edge.\t\n",

    "We hypothesize that a predictive model using player performance metrics, game location, opponent defensive stats, and team offensive context can accurately estimate how many points an NBA superstar will score in a given game. We expect that variables such as PPG, FGA, eFG%, TS%, home/away status, opponent defensive rating, opponent FG% allowed, opponent PPG allowed, team offensive rating, and team pace will show strong relationships with individual scoring. By capturing these factors, we believe the model will be able to make accurate point predictions within a reasonable margin. We believe this will be the outcome because superstar scoring is influenced by consistent patterns in usage, shooting efficiency, and team context, which are reflected in the metrics we selected."

    "This dataset contains NBA player and team statistics from 1947 to the present. For this project, we are focusing on the 2014–2025 seasons and 50 superstar players. Each observation represents a single player's performance in one game. Important variables in this dataset include Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%), True Shooting Percentage (TS%), opponent defensive rating, opponent field goal percentage allowed, opponent points per game allowed, team offensive rating, and team pace. These variables help us capture how efficiently players score and how difficult their matchups are.\n",

    "This dataset contains NBA player and team statistics from the 1947 season through the present. For our project, we will focus on the 2014–2025 seasons and only include 50 superstar players.

Important variables include Points per Game (PPG), Field Goal Attempts (FGA), Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%), True Shooting Percentage (TS%), game location (home/away), opponent defensive rating, opponent field goal percentage allowed, opponent points per game allowed, team offensive rating, and team pace.\n",

This will allow us to match each player's performance with the opponent and team context for that specific game.

    "There should not be significant privacy or ethical concerns with the data we are collecting, as it comes from public sources like the NBA’s official statistics website, Basketball-Reference, and APIs such as nba_api. These sources are reputable and widely used for research and fan analysis. Since player statistics, team metrics, and game schedules are already publicly available, we are not using any private or personally identifiable information. However, one potential ethical concern is the use of injury information. While injury status is often publicly reported, we will treat it cautiously and avoid making assumptions about a player's health or long-term performance based on brief injury labels. We will only use high-level injury status (e.g., whether the player played or not) and not speculate beyond that.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a potential bias in who is included in our dataset, as we are only focusing on the top 50 scorers in the league. This could skew our model toward players with high offensive usage and media exposure, possibly ignoring players from smaller-market teams or more defensive-focused roles. While this limitation is acceptable for our specific research question, which targets high-scoring players, we acknowledge that it may limit the generalizability of our model. Additionally, factors such as national TV coverage, travel schedules, or coaching decisions may introduce unseen biases that impact player performance but are difficult to quantify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation is that our model may not fully account for game context such as crowd influence, altitude, or locker room issues—factors that are hard to measure but can influence performance. We will also be cautious about interpreting our model’s predictions as exact truths; instead, we will present them as probabilistic estimates with expected variance. Since our project may appeal to fantasy sports or betting audiences, we will include a clear disclaimer that our model is for educational use only and should not be taken as financial advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these concerns, we will review our dataset for coverage gaps (e.g., missing games, skewed representation of certain teams or players), compare prediction accuracy across player types, and document any trends or outliers. During analysis, we will flag inconsistencies or anomalies and conduct additional research to decide whether they reflect natural variance or underlying bias. Finally, before finalizing our results, we will proofread our conclusions with an eye toward ethical communication and may ask for outside feedback to catch unintentional bias in our interpretations."
